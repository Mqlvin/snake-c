# Snake Game
Rough implementation of the game Snake, with SDL2 and C.
<br>
I might implement a ring buffer for the snake body in future, to improve performance.
<br>
Unfortunately it's all in one file so it's a bit of a mess.

All other (messy) elements of the splash screen are made by my awful artistic skills!
